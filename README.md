# SoapBox - SOAP Integration Support Training Tool

SoapBox is an interactive web application designed to help software engineers master SOAP API integration through hands-on training with realistic error scenarios. This comprehensive training platform simulates common integration issues in payment systems and guides users through debugging and resolution processes.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Interactive Scenario System**: Browse categorized SOAP error scenarios
- **Code Editor**: Syntax-highlighted SOAP XML editor with Monaco Editor
- **Response Viewer**: Real-time response display with error highlighting
- **Resolution System**: Step-by-step fix demonstration with explanations
- **Custom Scenarios**: Create, save, and share your own scenarios
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore scenario collections

### ðŸ“š Scenario Categories
- **XML Structure Errors**: Malformed XML, missing elements, namespace issues
- **Authentication Issues**: Missing credentials, expired tokens, wrong methods
- **Certificate Problems**: SSL certificate errors, validation failures
- **Server-side Errors**: HTTP 500 errors, service unavailability, rate limiting
- **Timeout Issues**: Connection timeouts, request timeouts
- **Payment-specific Errors**: Invalid amounts, currency issues, card validation

### ðŸŽ¨ User Interface
- **VS Code-inspired Design**: Dark theme with familiar color palette
- **Three-panel Layout**: Sidebar, code editor, and response viewer
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Efficient navigation and interaction
- **Collapsible Panels**: Maximize workspace when needed

3. **View Response**: See the error response in the right panel
4. **Resolve the Issue**: Click "Resolve Issue" to see the corrected request
5. **Learn**: Read the explanation to understand what was wrong and how it was fixed

### Creating Custom Scenarios
1. Click "Add Scenario" in the sidebar
2. Fill in the scenario details:
   - Name and description
   - Category and difficulty level
   - Request XML (with intentional errors)
   - Error response XML
   - Success response XML
   - Fixed request XML (optional)
   - Explanation of the issue
   - Tags for organization
3. Save the scenario to your collection

### Import/Export
- **Export**: Download your scenarios as a JSON file
- **Import**: Upload scenario collections from JSON files
- **Share**: Exchange scenario files with team members

## Technical Details
